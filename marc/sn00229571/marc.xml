Following the Great Fire of Jacksonville (FL) in 1901, the newspaper was published in both Jacksonville and DeLand (FL). The Weekly Industrial Record was continued by Florida's Financial and Industrial Record [LCCN: 2006229550] in October 1909.</subfield></datafield><datafield ind1="1" ind2=" " tag="520"><subfield code="a">The newspaper was the official organ of the Turpentine Operators' Association, carrying the mottoes "Dedicated to the naval stores and lumber interests" and "The exponent of southern progress". The newspaper carried a wide range of stories, mostly dedicated to the economic health and well being of northeast Florida. At the turn of the Century, Jacksonville was becoming established as Florida's economic hub. The Weekly Industrial Record published during the decline of the shipping industry and the rise of the railroad. Jacksonville's seaport, opened in 1903, was then, as it is now, an important gateway to Florida and the southeastern United States of America. The Port of Jacksonville challenged the Port of Savannah (GA), then unrivaled in the American south for trade in shipping. The St. Johns River watershed that drained through Jacksonville and its Port was fed by the vast areas of northeast and central Florida. Turpentine industry products that flowed through the Port also supported a wide range of other products. Railways entering Florida from the eastern seaboard passed through Jacksonville and formed a vector of agricultural and human traffic. The railroads transported tourists into Florida and carried woodland products and vegetables out.</subfield></datafield><datafield ind1="1" ind2=" " tag="520"><subfield code="a">The United States Postal Commission of 1907 listed the Weekly Industrial Record as a newspaper; and, it reached a fairly broad and wide-spread audience throughout Florida and the southeastern United States. The turn-of-the-century battle over the peonage system, sometimes referred to as the second coming of slavery, is played out in opposing camps in the pages of the Weekly Industrial Record on one side and Jacksonville's Florida Times-Union [LCCN sn83045831] on the other.
