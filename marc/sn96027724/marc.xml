It began publishing in 1878 and ceased publication in 1911. In the 1884 edition of Edwin Aldin &amp; Bro.'s American Newspaper Catalogue [LCCN a18000248], the publication is described as a large eight-page newspaper, the cost of a one-year subscription was two dollars. The newspaper was said to inform readers of "the capabilities of the State of Florida, its productions and resources," and it was "full of the experiences of Old Settlers and an instructor for the new." "You will learn," the American Newspaper Catalogue continued, "from it all about orange culture and other semi-tropical fruit, market gardening, etc., besides much general information of interest about all parts of the state." Prior to passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, a surprising number of Chinese immigrants made their way to Florida, and their labor in state agriculture was strongly supported by the Florida Agriculturist (see the issues for 24 January 1874 and 9 March 1881). Growing agricultural businesses, shipping industries, railroad schedules and other topics of interest to Florida's agricultural communities is also reported. The address for subscriptions to the Florida Agriculturist was C. Codrington &amp; Co., DeLand, Florida, the presumed publishing location. In 1878 and still at the turn of the 20th century, DeLand was a cross-roads of sorts for Florida. Located in Volusia County (FL) on the Atlantic Ocean, DeLand was, for a time, a terminal point and later a hub for railways reaching into southern Florida. With the expansion of railroad lines in Florida and the opening of the Port of Jacksonville in the later part of the first decade of the 20th century, DeLand would eventually be supplanted by Jacksonville (FL) as an economic hub of Florida.The Florida Agriculturist was a weekly from its start in 1878 through 1907. It became a monthly in 1908 continuing through June 1911 when it ceased publication. The editor was C. Codrington in 1878. Codrington, a native of Jamaica, was an importer of ornamental and exotic plants into Florida. Many Codrington plants were used in the landscaping of new Florida tourist attractions. Many catalogers of U.S. newspapers regard the Florida Agriculturist as a periodical rather than as a newspaper because plant orders could be sent to the newspaper's subscriptions office and others, because the newspaper functioned so well, and in all likelihood originally, as a catalog for the C. Codrington Company. One source (Geo. P. Rowell and Co.'s American Newspaper Directory [LCCN sn82007064]) suggests that the newspaper was established as early as 1874, but this may have been a forerunner of the newspaper, perhaps even a catalog for the C. Codrington Company. The Codrington family also published other newspapers in DeLand, among them the DeLand (FL) News [LCCN sn92062121]. E.O. Painter was publisher and editor in 1887. According to his obituary published in the Proceedings of the American Pomological Society, 33rd biennial session, Painter came to DeLand from New York with his parents at the age of sixteen, largely unschooled but an avid reader. He cleared land for his own orange grove and went to work for the Florida Agriculturist as a journeyman printer. In 1885, he bought a half-interest in the paper and later bought a whole interest paid for by the sale of an orange grove. Painter was so successful that the E.O. Painter Printing Company spun off from the Florida Agriculturist and, today (ca. 2008) remains as one of Florida's oldest and most successful printers. Painter continued as editor and owner of the Florida Agriculturist until 1907, when he sold all of his rights and interests in the paper, which was subsequently published in Jacksonville. The Port of Jacksonville had opened the previous year and the City of Jacksonville had begun to supplant DeLand as an economic center in Florida.--E.
