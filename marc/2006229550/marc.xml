Both titles published from Jacksonville, Florida. Florida's Financial and Industrial Record originally published as a weekly. In November 1910, however, it began publishing semi-monthly. Both the generalization of the news it carried and increasing competition from other Jacksonville newspapers as that city industrialized led to declining readership. Florida's Financial and Industrial Record ceased sometime in 1912; an exact date of last issue is unknown.</subfield></datafield><datafield ind1="1" ind2=" " tag="520"><subfield code="a">At the turn of the century, Jacksonville established itself as Florida's economic hub. The Weekly Industrial Record published during the decline of the shipping industry and the rise of the railroad. Jacksonville's seaport, opened in 1903, was then, as it is now, an important gateway to Florida and the southeastern United States of America. The Port of Jacksonville challenged the Port of Savannah (GA), then unrivaled in the American south for trade in shipping. The St. Johns River watershed that drained through Jacksonville and its Port was fed by the vast areas of northeast and central Florida. Turpentine industry products that flowed through the Port also supported a wide range of other products. Railways entering Florida from the eastern seaboard passed through Jacksonville and formed a vector of agricultural and human traffic. By the end of the century's first decade, the railroads transported tourists into Florida and carried woodland products and vegetables out in almost equal measures.</subfield></datafield><datafield ind1="1" ind2=" " tag="520"><subfield code="a">Florida's Financial and Industrial Record, like the Weekly Industrial Record, published as the official organ of the Turpentine Operators' Association and the Interstate Cane Growers' Association, carrying the motto "An unvarnished tale of Florida as it is". The motto, changed from that of the Weekly Industrial Record, "Dedicated to the naval stores and lumber interests" and "The exponent of southern progress", together with the stories it carried, suggest the State's growing tension between mostly inland farming and mostly sea-side tourism. Following the Florida's Financial and Industrial Record's demise, the tide of tourism would begin to change in its favor. Florida cities in proximity of the shore would begin to change their names incorporating the word "Beach": Fernandina Beach, Daytona Beach, etc. But, in this turn of the decade era (1909-1912), agriculture and agricultural industries represented the general health and well being of Florida. These industries touched nearly every life in Florida outside those of the growing tourism related industries. -- E.
